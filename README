CSX2.py can be used to compare chemical shifts calculated from simulated ensemble of structures with experimental chemical shifts from NMRspectroscopy.
A guide to the script's options is available running:
python CSX2.py -h

This script calculates X^2 values based on experimental values and predicted values.
Chisquare is calculated as:

     ((CS_pred - CS_exp)**2)/(CS_exp) 

where CS_pred is the cummulative average predicted chemical shifts and CS_exp is the experimentally obtained chemical shifts.
Predictors can be carried out with PPM (old version, needs pre-run of ppm_linux generating proton_details.dat and bb_details.dat files (recommended for first run)). 
PPM_One new version (ppm_linux need to be executable in the same folder of the pdb file example.pdb).

In this repository and example is provided with a pdb file (example.pdb) and the corresponding experimental CS (ChemicalShifts.dat).
